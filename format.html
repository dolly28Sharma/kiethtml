    <p>Soft landing simply means landing at a gentle, controlled speed to not sustain damage to a spacecraft. <br><b>Amitabha Ghosh</b>, a scientist for NASA’s Rover mission to Mars, </br>explained it in The Indian Express thus:<i>“Imagine a spacecraft hurtling through space</i>,<br> at 10 times the speed of an airplane, having to nearly come to a standstill in order to land gently on the Earth <br> all in a matter of a few minutes and, more importantly, without any human intervention</i>. This, in a nutshell, is a <b><u>soft landing.</u></b>”</p>
